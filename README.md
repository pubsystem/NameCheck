In main.js I write some function to handle the model popup's open and it's better to fetch data here. (in formValidate function)
My idea is to use event listener to monitor all tool buttons. Depending on the button clicked, different parameters should be passed to call the corresponding API and render the associated model content. I have provided relevant comments in my JavaScript file.

initialize.js is use to handle some feature related to local Storage. like page appearance mode and login information
